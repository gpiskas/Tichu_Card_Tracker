Tichu Card Tracker
=================

An Android (cards) application. This was the first android application I ever made!

This application was created in order to assist you in the card game Tichu. What it actually does is keep track of the cards that players use. This way, you will always be aware of how many colors are left for any selected card.

The repository structure is based on the Eclipse IDE android project layout. You can import the code there and start coding!
